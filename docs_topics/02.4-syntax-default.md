### 2.4 The default statement

The `default` statement is unusual in that it has no behaviour at runtime.  At
compile time the `default` statement alters the behaviour of the compiler with
respect to what happens at the end of the ruleset parse.

If, when Lace has finished parsing the ruleset, the last allow or deny was not
unconditional, then the compiler will, in the absence of a `default` statement,
inject a terminal `allow`/`deny` of the opposite sense of the last explicit
operation, unconditionally and with a reason of the empty string.

If a `default` statement was encountered during processing then its chosen
behaviour will be used instead.

The syntax of the `default` statement is:

    default 'allow' <reason>?

or

    default 'deny' <reason>?

If reasons are not provided, the string "Default behaviour" is
substituted.

Once a single `default` statement has been encountered during
compilation; it is an error, and the compiler WILL cease, if it
encounters an additional `default` statement.

Since it's common for rulesets to stem from a single core point, therefore it
is recommended that the application define a `default` policy at the start of
these core statements.
